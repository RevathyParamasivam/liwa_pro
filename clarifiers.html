        <h3>Primary Clarifier</h3>
        <div class="section-header-pro-inner">
            <p>The flocculated effluent will enter into the circular primary clarifier made of RCC construction through the center feed pipe. The clarifier has circular geometry and has a drive mechanism, access platform, rake arm mechanism mounted on it. From the center feed pipe, effluent will enter into the settling zone of the clarifier. The clarifier will be designed based on the settling velocity particle. In the settling zone, the flocculated particle will be settling down and forms sludge at the bottom of the clarifier. The clarifier will have two scrapper rake arms settled sludge. The settled sludge shall be transferred into the sludge holding tank by gravity. The clarified water will rise at the top of the clarifier and will be collected into the outlet weir. From the weir, it will be collected into the clarified water storage tank by gravity.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Secondary Clarifier</h3>
        <div class="section-header-pro-inner">
            <p>The function of the secondary clarifier is to separate the activated sludge solids from the mixed liquor that is generated in Aeration tank. These solids represent the colloidal and dissolved solids that were originally present in the wastewater. In the aeration unit they were incorporated into the activated sludge floc, which are settleable solids. The separation of these solids, a critical step in the activated sludge process, is accomplished in the secondary clarifier. The excess sludge production from secondary clarifier is pumped to sludge holding tank by a tapping from RAS pump. The purpose of return sludge is to maintain MLSS concentration of activated sludge in the aeration tank sufficient for the desired degree of treatment.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>High Rate Solid Contact Clarifier</h3>
        <div class="section-header-pro-inner">
            <p>HIGH RATE SOLID CONTACT CLARIFICATION (HRSCC) Water clarification is the process of removing suspended solids, turbidity, colloids from water. The HRSCC has been designed such that coagulation, flocculation, settling and sludge removal are combined in a single tank. HRSCC is designed to treat different types of water for various applications of solid settling and separation. These units are tailor-made to suit various flow rates and can be designed for very large flows. For optimum operation & effective solid separation, HRSCC employs the use of a flash mixer and stilling chamber before clarifier. Typically chemical treatment using Alum, Zinc, and polyelectrolyte is used to aid coagulation & flocculation and enhance removal of solids.</p>
            <P>HRSCC comprises of the following:</P>
        </div>

        <ul class="bullet">
                        <li>Draft Tube </li>
						<li>Reaction Well </li>
						<li>Central Reaction Turbine </li>
						<li>Sludge Blanket zone </li>
						<li>Rake arm </li>      
        </ul>
        <div class="section-header-pro-inner">
        <P>There are two drives in the HRSCC: one drives the sludge disposal rake and the other drives the turbine mixer which re-circulates the sludge.</P>
        <br>
        <p>Coagulation, flocculation, settling and sludge removal are combined into a single tank. Concentrated solids, which have earlier settled in the clarifier, are recirculated to the mixing zone by the turbine and mixed with the incoming influent which has a relatively low concentration of suspended solids. The rate of flocculation is directly dependent on the solid's concentration (by volume). Therefore by recirculating the settled floc, the amount of solids increases, thereby improving flocculation and hence the name Solids Contact Clarifier. This also results in a lower requirement of coagulation chemicals since the contact of this floc which has been formed earlier with new floc results in good growth of the same. This water then flows into the reaction well where the solids coagulate and settle. The flow passes through the sludge blanket at the bottom of the reaction well and this further removes suspended particles. The rotating rake arm moves the settled solids or sludge to the center of the clarifier for removal. The flow rises upward in the clarification zone and water is removed by the radial collection troughs on the surface. A portion of the settled sludge is periodically drawn off by opening the blow-down valve. The recirculation of sludge results in the HRSCC producing water of very low turbidity for a wide range of inlet suspended solids levels and even in conditions of low inlet turbidity.</p>
